# Zip Opener


Windows 10 does not open AES-encrypted files by default. This python utility allows you to open zip files that have been password protected using AES. 

## Installation Steps:

1. Save the python files on your local
2. Optionally Install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) if the file was protected using 7-zip.
3. Run the Python script `python aes_zip_opener.py`. If the file was password protected using 7-zip, use `python aes-zip-opener-7zip.py`
